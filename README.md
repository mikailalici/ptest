The Verification and Validation model makes sure that proper rules have been followed at the time of the development of a software product and it fulfills the required specifications of the customer. This detecting and fixing of the errors reduces the risk associated with any software.

Constraint solver project  is a genetic algorithm solution for high dimensional, complex constraint solver. The genetic algorithm has all of its features implemented in genetic.py file In case of fitness calculation of the population, the constraint.py has been used that actually counts the number of given Constraint s the population solves.
